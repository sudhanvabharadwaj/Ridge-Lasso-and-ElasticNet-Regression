# Ridge-Lasso-and-ElasticNet-Regression

A simple demonstration of Ridge, Lasso and ElasticNet Regression on the Algerian Forest Fires Dataset.The dataset includes 244 instances that regroup a data of two regions of Algeria,namely the Bejaia region located in the northeast of Algeria and the Sidi Bel-abbes region located in the northwest of Algeria.

### About the Dataset
1. Date : (DD/MM/YYYY) Day, month ('june' to 'september'), year (2012)
Weather data observations 
2. Temp : temperature noon (temperature max)  in Celsius degrees: 22 to 42
3. RH : Relative Humidity in %: 21 to 90 
4. Ws :Wind speed in km/h: 6 to 29 
5. Rain: total day in mm: 0 to 16.8
FWI Components  
6. Fine Fuel Moisture Code (FFMC) index from the FWI system: 28.6 to 92.5 
7. Duff Moisture Code (DMC) index from the FWI system: 1.1 to 65.9 
8. Drought Code (DC) index from the FWI system:  7 to 220.4
9. Initial Spread Index (ISI) index from the FWI system: 0 to 18.5 
10. Buildup Index (BUI) index from the FWI system: 1.1 to 68
11. Fire Weather Index (FWI) Index: 0 to 31.1
12. Classes: two classes, namely 'fire' and 'not fire'

### Procedure
- Performed Data Cleaning, Exploratory Data Analysis and Feature Engineering to analyse the dataset and obtain a cleaned data for further analysis.
- Have used Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression and ElasticNet Regression on the data.
- Performed hyperparameter tuning using Cross Validation techniques.
